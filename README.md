This repository contains some mini projects from 2021 and 2022 that I built, as part of data science interview assessments that lasted 1 to 2 weeks each. 
All were fun to solve, and acquainted me to different applied machine learning problems relevant to the industry. 


1. Credit Card Fraud (Capital One - Early 2022)

Build features and models for credit card fraud transactions. Supervised, Imbalanced binary classification was the focus of this problem. 

2. AWS usage model (Prosimio.io - Early 2022)

Time series regression and outlier analysis for a startup called Prosimio.io. Involved thinking about the problem in an unsupervised way.

3. Neustar Identity Theft classification (Neustar, now TransUnion - Early 2022)

Similar to Credit Card fraud, but the transaction was now a credit card application with fake identity data. The focus of this project was more on feature generation and the utilization of dask for parallel processing on pandas dataframes.


4. Optoro Price Prediction Problem. (Optoro - 2021)

Price prediction, focus was mainly on Regression.
